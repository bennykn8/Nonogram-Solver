# Nonogram-Solver

## A recursive approach to solve nonogram puzzles

### About nonograms:
The board starts out empty, filled with undetermined/unverified blocks (" "). 
In a nonogram puzzle, numeric clues are given on each row and column. 
In each respective row or column, the set of clues represents the groupings of the filled blocks ("#") in the row/col. 
Each grouping must be separated by at least one crossed-out block ("_") .

For example, a size 10 row with the clues 3, 1, 2 could look like {#,#,#,_,_,#,_,#,#,_} or {_,#,#,#,_,#,_,_,#,#} and etc.

The challenge of the puzzle of to validly fill the each row/column without making a move that would be inconsistant with the clues in other rows/columns.


### About the program:
#### User Input:
The program will prompt you the either use and select a preset puzzle or manually enter in the specifications and clues for a puzzle.

#### Algorithm:
The recursive method compiles a complete list of all of the possible combinations of the respective row/column. 
After a loop runs through the list and tallies how many times a filled block is present at each index. 
If the index has 0 possible occurances, then there must be a crossed-out block there ("_"). 
If the index has a filled block in every occurance, then there must be a filled block there("#").

This process is repeated for all rows and columns until the puzzle is solved and left without an undetermined block.
